# Useful git commands.

## Credentials

Caching Credentials
```
git config --global credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
```

## Branch commands
Get list of all branches on remote
```
git branch -a
```

Look at a remote's information; this also shows tracking information
```
git remote show <remote-name e.g. origin>
```

Create a branch and set it to track a remote branch
```
git checkout -b <new-branch> remotes/<remote-name>/branch-to-track
# the remote branch name can be read off from the output of git branch -a
```

### Merge related commands
Show which branches have been merged (or not merged). Merged branches can be deleted.
``` 
git branch --merged
git branch --no-merged
```

Deleting a (merged) branch; this doesn't work if the branch is not merged, in which case you need to use a force delete switch (-D)
```
git branch -d <branchname>
```
