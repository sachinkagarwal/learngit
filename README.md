Experimenting with Git
======================

This is an experiment with Git.

## Experiment 1
Creating a branch
```
git checkout -b feature/TKT-2
```
Creating a new remote branch that the new local branch can track
```
git push -u <remote> feature/TKT-2
#To list the remote names run "git remote -vv", it is usually "origin" if not specified"
```

## Experiment 2
Merging a change into another branch
First, commit any work on the branch you are working on.

Here is the feature branch change.
